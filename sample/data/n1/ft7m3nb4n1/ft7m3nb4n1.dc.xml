    <description>How did the fear of death coexist with the promise of Christian afterlife in the
      culture and literature of the English Renaissance? Robert Watson exposes a sharp edge of
      blasphemous protest against mortality that runs through revenge plays such as The Spanish
      Tragedy and Hamlet, and through plays of procreation such as Measure for Measure and Macbeth.
      Tactics of denial appear in the vengefulness that John Donne directs toward female bodies for
      failing to bestow immortality, and in the promise of renewal that George Herbert sets against
      the threat of closure.Placing these literary manifestations in the context of specific
      Jacobean deathbed crises and modern cultural distortions, Watson explores the psychological
      roots and political consequences of denying that death permanently erases sensation and consciousness.</description>

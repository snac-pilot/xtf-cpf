         <title>The Opening of the Apartheid Mind: Options for the New South Africa</title>
         <creator>Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley</creator>
         <subject>African Studies</subject>
         <subject>Politics</subject>
         <subject>African History</subject>
         <description>Refusing to be governed by what is fashionable or inoffensive, Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley frankly address <term>the</term> passions and rationalities that drive politics in post-apartheid South Africa. They argue that <term>the</term> country's quest for democracy is widely misunderstood and that public opinion abroad relies on stereotypes of violent tribalism and false colonial analogies.Adam and Moodley criticize <term>the</term> personality cult surrounding Nelson Mandela and <term>the</term> accolades accorded F. W. de Klerk. They reject <term>the</term> black-versus-white conflict and substitute sober analysis and strategic pragmatism for <term>the</term> moral outrage that typifies so much writing about South Africa. Believing that <term>the</term> best expression of solidarity emanates from sympathetic but candid criticism, they pose challenging questions for <term>the</term> African National Congress and Nelson Mandela. They give in-depth coverage to political violence, <term>the</term> ANC-South African Communist Party alliance, Inkatha, and other controversial topics as well.The authors do not propose a solution that will guarantee a genuinely democratic South Africa. What they offer is an understanding of <term>the</term> country's social conditions and political constraints, and they sketch options for both a new South Africa and a new post-Cold War foreign policy for <term>the</term> whole of southern Africa. <term>The</term> importance of this book is as immediate as today's headlines.</description>

         <title>Thirty-Eight Witnesses: The Kitty Genovese Case</title>
         <creator>A.M. Rosenthal</creator>
         <subject>Politics</subject>
         <subject>Sociology</subject>
         <subject>Urban Studies</subject>
         <description>In a decade scarred by some of <term>the</term> worst tragedies in this country's history, March 13, 1964, stands apart from <term>the</term> other atrocities, not because of <term>the</term> identity of <term>the</term> victim - whose name was not Kennedy, King, or Malcolm - but because of <term>the</term> circumstances. Kitty Genovese was a 28-year-old middle-class woman from Kew Gardens, Queens, whose murder was distinguished by <term>the</term> presence of thirty-eight witnesses who did nothing to stop <term>the</term> series of attacks that would claim her life.Thirty years later <term>the</term> Kitty Genovese murder still presses us to ask a litany of questions: Why did these people fail to act? What does it say about <term>the</term> conditions of contemporary urban life? Would it happen today? First published over thirty years ago, Thirty-Eight Witnesses remains a social document that warrants close and repeated examination. <term>The</term> account of <term>the</term> story, as related by one of <term>the</term> best-known and most controversial newspaper professionals in <term>the</term> country, has <term>the</term> added dimension of being part memoir, part investigative journalism, and part public service. In an updated preface that incorporates <term>the</term> most recent developments in <term>the</term> case, A.M. Rosenthal examines why <term>the</term> murder of Kitty Genovese still has <term>the</term> power to shock in a world jaded by news of urban violence.</description>

         <title>The Problems of a Political Animal: Community, Justice, and Conflict in Aristotelian Political Thought</title>
         <creator>Bernard R. Yack</creator>
         <subject>Politics</subject>
         <subject>Philosophy</subject>
         <subject>Political Theory</subject>
         <subject>Social and Political Thought</subject>
         <subject>Social Theory</subject>
         <description>A bold new interpretation of Aristotelian thought is central to Bernard Yack's provocative new book. He shows that for Aristotle, community is a conflict-ridden fact of everyday life, as well as an ideal of social harmony and integration. From political justice and <term>the</term> rule of law to class struggle and moral conflict, Yack maintains that Aristotle intended to explain <term>the</term> conditions of everyday political life, not just, as most commentators assume, to represent <term>the</term> hypothetical achievements of an idealistic "best regime."By showing how Aristotelian ideas can provide new insight into our own political life, Yack makes a valuable contribution to contemporary discourse and debate. His work will excite interest among a wide range of social, moral, and political theorists.</description>

         <title>Asylia: Territorial Inviolability in the Hellenistic World</title>

         <subject>Classical Politics</subject>
         <description>In <term>the</term> Hellenistic period certain Greek temples and cities came to be declared "sacred and inviolable." Asylia was <term>the</term> practice of declaring religious places precincts of asylum, meaning they were immune to violence and civil authority. <term>The</term> evidence for this phenomenon - mainly inscriptions and coins - is scattered in <term>the</term> published record. <term>The</term> material has never been collected and presented in one publication until now.Kent J. Rigsby lays out these documents and discusses their historical implications in a substantial introduction. He argues that while a hopeful intention of military neutrality lay behind <term>the</term> institution of asylum, <term>the</term> declarations did not in fact change military behavior. Instead, "declared inviolability" became a civic and religious honor for which cities across <term>the</term> Greek world competed during <term>the</term> third to first centuries B.C.</description>

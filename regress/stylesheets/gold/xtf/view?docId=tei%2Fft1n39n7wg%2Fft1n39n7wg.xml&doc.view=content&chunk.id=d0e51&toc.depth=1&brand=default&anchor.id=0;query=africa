            <h2 class="Heading-Heading2">PREFACE TO THE PAPERBACK EDITION</h2>
            <p class="noindent">Enormous changes have occurred since <i>The Nuclear Seduction</i> was written, among them the end of the Cold War, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the announcement of major nuclear arms reductions, the war in the Gulf, the emergence of the so-called New World Order, the settling down of some armed conflicts (e.g., Nicaragua, Angola), and the outbreak of new ones (e.g., Yugoslavia and fighting between the fragments of the old Soviet Union). Coinciding with these changes is a general perception that the danger of nuclear war is now essentially past, our only remaining tasks being to complete the current cycle of nuclear arms reductions and to keep nuclear weapons away from erratic Third World dictators like Saddam Hussein.</p>
            <p class="noindent">Although <i>The Nuclear Seduction</i> primarily concerns the events and debates of the Cold War, with much of its interest now historical, the fundamental nature of the nuclear danger remains as misunderstood now as it was in the 1980s. Today as in the past, states, political parties, and academic "experts" cloak the issue in abstractions that serve the interests of the commentators more than the truth, conveniently pointing fingers at official enemies while obscuring more uncomfortable problems that lie closer to home. And while the immediate risk of global conflagration has certainly declined, the long-term danger remains and could in fact intensify dramatically in the coming years. As much as before the end of the Cold War, concerned citizens must look beneath ideologies, learn something about the real history of the nuclear age, and oppose dangerous actions by powerful states, including their own.</p>
            <p class="noindent">Two questions arise: 1) Where do the nuclear dangers of the post-Cold War world reside? and 2) What relevance do the findings of <i>The Nuclear Seduction</i> have to these dangers?</p>
            <p class="noindent">The nuclear dangers of the current era cannot be understood unless we first grasp where the dangers of the Cold War period lay. The historical record reviewed in this book makes clear that over the last forty years the nuclear danger has been real and has resulted primarily from reckless actions by the</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">vi</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">nuclear-armed states during Third World conflicts. By their own admission, the leaders of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries <i>knew</i> that their actions could have led to the use of nuclear weapons on numerous occasions. In short, the nuclear states were willing to risk igniting a nuclear war to achieve political goals.</p>
            <p class="noindent">Much effort was required to obscure this simple reality, since the populations of the nuclear states, particularly democracies like the United States, Britain, and Israel, could not be expected to go along quietly with these periodic throws of cosmic dice. Many of the events we describe were simply covered up or distorted at the time they occurred. And at the ideological level, politically unthreatening frameworks for understanding the nuclear danger were developed.</p>
            <p class="noindent">One of these was branding the enemy the sole source of the problem—for example, the United States blamed the "Soviet Threat" and the Soviet Union blamed "imperalist aggression." These explanations necessitated considerable finessing of the historical record since in reality both superpowers as well as other states contributed to the danger of nuclear war. Our review suggests that in general the United States actually displayed far more nuclear recklessness than the Soviet Union (a finding that should not be forgotten when the new histories of the Cold War are written).</p>
            <p class="noindent">A related mechanism for obscuring the real sources of nuclear danger was to invent another abstraction, the arms race, and portray it as the nub of the problem. The original idea was that the enemy was racing dangerously ahead in weaponry—the faked "missile gap" of the 1960s and the absurd "window of vulnerability" of the 1980s are two examples. But "weaponitis," as we call the fixation on weapons, developed a broader ideological appeal since it converted the nuclear danger from a political problem requiring constraints on state violence to a technical problem requiring only adjustments in the numbers and technical characteristics of weapons.</p>
            <p class="noindent">Weaponitis provided a way to oppose the nuclear danger for those unwilling to criticize the political and military activities of their governments in the Third World. Hence, in the United States almost all opposition to official nuclear policy focused on the arms race, with some arguing for more mutual arms control by the superpowers and others for unilateral restraint by the United States on the grounds that we rather than the Soviets were achieving dangerous advantages that could destabilize the nuclear stalemate. A notable exception was the small group of scholars and activists who called attention to the nuclear dangers of U.S. intervention in Third World conflicts under the banner of the "deadly connection."</p>
            <p class="noindent">The Russian threat is now history (at least if you're not an Estonian or a Ukrainian) and apparently so is the nuclear arms race (at least if you're not an Indian or Pakistani). What effect do these changes have on the nuclear danger? The demise of the Soviet Union has eliminated the conflict that for the past forty years was most likely to lead to a worldwide nuclear war. Although other states besides the United States and the old Soviet Union—Britain, France, China, and probably Israel—have sufficiently large and sophisticated nuclear arsenals to obliterate major portions of the world, for the moment they seem unlikely to initiate major military conflicts with each other, with the United States, or with Russia. This reality is the kernel of truth in the current nuclear complacency.</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">vii</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">The end of the superpower nuclear arms race is of comparatively minor importance. As <i>The Nuclear Seduction</i> documents, since at least the mid-sixties the arms race had little to do with the risk of nuclear war. The nuclear arms race had tremendous economic, environmental, and ideological importance, but contrary to the Cold War propaganda and to abstract academic deterrence theory, it did not figure prominently in the actual crises and conflicts in which nuclear weapons might have been used. After the Soviets acquired a basic nuclear arsenal sometime around 1960, neither superpower ever achieved a useable nuclear superiority. As leaders on both sides seem to have understood throughout the Cold War, nuclear war would probably have meant the utter devastation of both societies, and much else, regardless of the weapons balance of the moment. Leaders were simply willing to risk this result on occasion.</p>
            <p class="noindent">The nuclear arms negotiations now being contemplated would leave both states with the power to destroy the other even after absorbing a surprise attack. Except for the possibility that smaller strategic arsenals entail a lower risk of accidental or unauthorized launch, they do not greatly reduce the risk of a nuclear war. And as <i>The Nuclear Seduction</i> explains, smaller arsenals do not necessarily reduce the damage that could be expected in the event of a nuclear war. The reductions of the INF treaty, START, and any future agreements are certainly welcome, but unless they someday virtually eliminate nuclear weapons, they cannot fundamentally change the nuclear stalemate. Their purpose is primarily political: to make the leaders who negotiate them look like responsible guardians of world peace.</p>
            <p class="noindent">One category of recent nuclear arms reductions does substantially reduce the risk of a nuclear war: the removal of tactical nuclear arms from ships and ground fighting forces. Tactical nuclear weapons designed to achieve advantage in a conventional battle pose unique dangers since they are under weak central control and could be used, with official authorization or without, in the heat of some future battle that no one intended to be nuclear. Potentially dangerous incidents have occurred. <i>The Nuclear Seduction</i> argued that radically reducing these weapons would be genuinely useful, and it appears that both Russia and the United States have now done that. Some of these weapons may be secretly retained aboard ships and elsewhere, and no doubt they could be rapidly reintroduced at will, but this is a technical change in the nuclear arsenal that we should enthusiastically applaud.</p>
            <p class="noindent">Since neither the "Soviet Threat" nor the nuclear arms race was ever the main source of nuclear danger, their demise does not eliminate that peril. The danger results from the possession of extraordinarily powerful weapons by states that engage in large-scale violence and whose leaders are willing to risk nuclear war to achieve political goals. One of the worst of those states is now gone, and with it the most dangerous conflict of the Cold War years. But Russia still possesses most of the old Soviet arsenal, and it and the other nuclear states can be expected to continue to act as powerful states always have. Moreover, in large part because of the worldwide spread of the nuclear-energy industry, other states are likely to join the nuclear club in the coming years.</p>
            <p class="noindent">This last prospect is conventionally discussed under the rubric of preventing "proliferation" and is often understood to mean keeping nuclear weapons away from erratic, violence-prone Third World leaders like Saddam Hussein. Many</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">viii</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">commentators suggest that apart from signing more arms control treaties, this is the only major task remaining for those concerned about averting a nuclear war.</p>
            <p class="noindent">"Proliferation" is another abstraction that frames the issue in a way that serves the interests of certain parties. Interestingly, this framework pins the nuclear danger on states that do <i>not</i> have nuclear weapons rather than those that do. Like most ideological constructions, the idea has a real germ of truth. No doubt all kinds of new dangers will arise as more states embroiled in regional and international conflicts acquire nuclear weapons. We have little reason to hope that the leaders of these states will exercise more caution than the other nuclear states did in the events described in this book. In some cases, Third World states could prove even more reckless; unlike any current members of the nuclear club, some face conventional military threats to their survival. The possibility of truly insane leaders acquiring the Bomb also exists, although official hysteria about this matter is rather cynical, for "craziness" is a political judgment more than a psychological one. The United States says Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait shows he is deluded and impulsive, but others would say the same of Richard Nixon for the United States invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War or of Menachem Begin for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.</p>
            <p class="noindent">While its official definition is the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons, in practice "non-proliferation" policy is applied selectively in accordance with political needs. The United States, for example, bombed Iraq's reactors but provided enormous political and military aid to Pakistan and Israel while they were developing their own nuclear arsenals. Just as states have been willing to risk nuclear war to achieve political goals, they have been willing to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to the Third World when it suits their interests.</p>
            <p class="noindent">It is comfortable to believe that acquisition of nuclear weapons by the occasional lunatic is the only remaining danger. Unfortunately, for the time being at least the main dangers come from the extremely powerful states that already possess substantial nuclear arsenals. That should not be surprising, but the United States and its nuclear allies have successfully promoted the self-serving idea that they are responsible nuclear guardians whose actions we need not fear.</p>
            <p class="noindent">The unpleasant truth is that in the future as in the past the United States and the other nuclear states may be willing to risk nuclear war during serious conflicts and crises. Many opportunities will surely arise. The end of the Cold War is not the "end of history." The specific configurations of state conflict have changed, as they always do, but barring a far more fundamental revolution in politics we must expect that the general pattern of violent state conflict over resources, land, and power will continue.</p>
            <p class="noindent">Serious clashes between nuclear-armed powers seem only a matter of time. Already, some of the nuclear dangers of the "New World Order" have become apparent. With the demise of the Soviet deterrent, the United States is now free to use military force virtually at will, as it already has in the bombing of Libya, the invasion of Panama, and the merciless bombing of Iraqi cities during the Gulf War. After reorganizing itself toward capitalism, Russia may well resume its traditional hegemonic activities. Some of the ex-Soviet republics may secretly retain tactical nuclear weapons or the materials for making them in order to deter Russia, to provide leverage in conflicts with each other, or to sell; one press report suggested that already Kazakhstan may have transferred two such weapons to</p>

The most obvious danger at the moment lies in the violent confrontation between India and Pakistan in Kashmir that could end up in a fourth war, this time with both combatants able to build nuclear weapons.

Israel, with a large nuclear arsenal that apparently includes tactical nuclear weapons, reportedly put its nuclear weapons on alert on the second day of the Gulf War, as it had during the 1973 war. Israel may well enter into another major war with Arab states or Iran—countries with nuclear ambitions of their own. North Korea may be close to developing nuclear warheads, and South Korea and Japan might not wait long to do the same. Argentina and Brazil could both develop nuclear weapons fairly quickly, despite recent indications that they have given up this ambition.</p>
            <p class="noindent">To confront the nuclear dangers of the coming years, citizens will require an understanding of the fundamental nature of nuclear weapons and the history of the nuclear age, the two main topics of <i>The Nuclear Seduction</i> . They will also require a healthy skepticism about official versions of nuclear truth and a willingness to oppose dangerous actions by their governments.</p>

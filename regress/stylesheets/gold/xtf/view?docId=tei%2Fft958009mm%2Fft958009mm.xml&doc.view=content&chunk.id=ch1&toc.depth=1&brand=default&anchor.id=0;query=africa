                  states; in fact, the removal of tyrants may make life worse when successors fight each other in endless civil wars. After the abolition of the apartheid system, for example, the

                  political and economic chaos, a more relevant classification groups the affluent, economically stable states (North America, Western Europe, Japan, and the newly industrialized Asian
                  countries) into one competing trading bloc. A second bloc consists of states with some resources and potential for growth as well as kinship ties and ideological affinities with the
                  first-tier states; this second bloc includes most of Latin America, some states in the Middle East and Asia, and South <a name="41"></a><a href="#40"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#42"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>.

They are
                  increasingly left to their own misery, at best the recipients of mere charity.</p>
               <p class="normal">This new North-South division ignores former ideological contests and is characterized by access to the dominant economic resources (credits, markets, and political support) of the
                  first bloc. Yet the powerful North neglects the powerless South at its own peril, for the importance of the South lies in its very weakness, in its capacity to destabilize the entire
                  globe. The worldwide effects of environmental degradation, the streams of economic refugees into the islands of comparative affluence, the spread of AIDS and other diseases, the
                  slaughter enacted in the name of religious or nationalist fundamentalism—what happens among the have-nots eventually affects the haves. It is this potential to cause chaos, or what
                  Dieter Senghaas refers to as <i>Chaosmacht,</i> that constitutes the power of the powerless.</p>

                  insulated from the have-nots. The highways and railways leading out of Cape Town, Johannesburg, or Durban cut right through the huge slums of Khayelitsha, Soweto, and Kwa Mashu.
                  While the violence of deprivation can be deflected on its victims, their struggles increasingly spill over into the fortifications of the affluent, who cannot enjoy their privileges
                  when the murder rate in Johannesburg is three times higher than that of the worst American city. Especially when the stability and security of the white minority depends directly on
                  the cooperative labor of the majority, its brutalization cannot be contained beyond the factory gates.</p>

                  between capital and labor. The society will either bring forth new forms of cooperative development and legitimacy or will disintegrate through ethnic violence and costly repression.
                  Europe increasingly perceives the South as burdensome; begging strangers are to be held at bay. Because the people of South <a name="46"></a><a href="#45"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#47"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> share a common citizenship, history, and economy,
                  they cannot retreat from or postpone the challenge. South Africans cannot divorce each other through partition without destroying their source of wealth. Unlike the centrifugal
                  ethnoregionalism in the rest of the world, centripetal forces in South <a name="47"></a><a href="#46"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#48"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> bind the antagonistic segments into a common state. The poorer regions are dependent on transfer
                  payments. It is out of this imperative that the world’s most backward political system of legal segregation could perhaps develop into an advanced model for the gradual solution of
                  the North-South cleavage through unitary federalism with regional autonomy.</p>
               <p class="normal">In global terms, given the ecological limitations, the North cannot sustain unlimited economic growth in the future, nor can the South ever hope to emulate or catch up with the
                  environmentally destructive Northern examples. The new forms of cooperation needed worldwide to preserve the ecosystem and enhance the quality of life could receive decisive impetus
                  from the one country that combines virtually all the starkest contradictions and predicaments within its borders. This elevates the study of South <a name="48"></a><a href="#47"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#49"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> beyond an esoteric regional

Is the conflict between the ANC and Inkatha a
                  forerunner of the same unnecessary war that happened in Zimbabwe between Mugabe and Nkomo, between Frelimo and Renamo in Mozambique, or between the MPLA and Unita in Angola before
                  they agreed to a ceasefire of sheer exhaustion? Are the material and ethnic divisions that have emerged after apartheid was suspended so deep that the accelerating political and
                  criminal violence ruins all prospects of growth? In short, is South <a name="50"></a><a href="#49"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#51"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> permanently trapped in a transition without development? Why has a seemingly inevitable black-white racial
                  conflict been replaced with much more widespread intrablack violence?</p>
               <p class="normal">In socioeconomic terms, the violent conflicts among blacks are essentially between insiders and outsiders. The cleavage between the early urbanized and the latecomers constitutes the
                  most fundamental faultline in black society. Privileged insider status had historically been confined to people with Section 10 rights, those legally resident in “white areas” and
                  entitled to work there. The other half, the mass of illegal jobseekers and shack dwellers, were harassed and kept in check by apartheid laws, were discarded and left to starve in the
                  countryside. With the abolition of influx control and apartheid repression, the competition over scarce goods became an intrablack affair. The conflict was transformed from one
                  between illegals and the police to an all-out struggle for space and survival between old-time residents and those desperately seeking access, now unconstrained by the state.
                  Ironically, the termination of unfeasible state regulations to control entry unleashed violent clashes within black society.</p>
               <p class="normal">This socioeconomic conflict assumed its political overtones through the historic alignment of old-time residents with the ANC and the civic associations. In areas where the majority
                  of the outsiders were migrant workers or squatters of Zulu origin, Inkatha voiced their interests. At the root, however, lies neither a “tribal” conflict nor an ANC/Inkatha feud. In
                  the Western Cape townships that have no Zulu migrants, the violent competition between insiders and outsiders developed with equal intensity at times, beyond the ANC’s or the civics’
                  ability to control it.</p>
               <p class="normal">The politicization of ethnicity (nationalism, tribalism) occurs everywhere in the world not only because ethnic exclusiveness provides scapegoats and explanations for hardship but
                  also because it eliminates competitors by exclusion. If one segment manages to restrict scarce goods (land, taxi routes, houses, schools, clinics) to its members only, it has
                  objectively increased its advantages in the general competition. Only in this respect is tribalism a “natural phenomenon.” Exclusion has little to do with historical animosities,
                  which are often invented, manipulated, and exploited by political mobilizers to gain an edge. This advantage then is further reinforced by the new emotional cohesion of the group, as
                  well as by the individual psychological satisfaction and enhanced identity that successful competition provides. In times of transition and crisis, symbolic rewards of a proud
                  identity compensate for material deprivation and general insecurity.</p>
               <p class="normal">Indeed, ethnonationalism must not be reduced to material interests only. Culture also embodies a moral order by which its members give meaning to their lives and derive rules of
                  behavior. In the competition for status and power, however, common culture and history seldom predetermine political identification, particularly in South <a name="51"></a><a href="#50"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#52"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>. Afrikaners are
                  deeply split about their strategies for survival. Zulu speakers, too, identify with opposing political movements, despite their shared appreciation of Zulu tradition. It is this
                  conflicting definition of political interests that matters. The focus on ethnicity by analysts such as Hermann Giliomee<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.3#X" target="_top">3</a>]</sup> overemphasizes common cultural conditioning at the expense of dissident redefinitions of identity, which soon gain majority support. In postapartheid South <a name="52"></a><a href="#51"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#53"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, both
                  whites and blacks are reassessing their political interests and identities now that circumstances entice inclusive instead of exclusive policies.</p>
               <p class="normal">Obviously, democratization, accompanied by political equality for all citizens and the promise of greater material justice, can lay the foundations for a more stable and less violent
                  political order. Yet the black constituency expects the government to negotiate itself <i>out</i> of power. However, Pretoria intends to negotiate itself <i>into</i> power in a future dispensation and in the meantime clings to control. What kind of power sharing would satisfy all parties and allow the leaderships in all
                  camps to sell the compromise to their constituencies? Will they accept a controversial elite compromise, which is likely to rely on shared authoritarian control rather than
                  democratic input from below, in order to shortchange the impossible demands of a vast excluded underclass?</p>
               <p class="normal">What is unlikely to pass as legitimate compromise is the current strategy of privatizing apartheid. In such South African codewords as “upholding standards,” “protecting community
                  values,” and “guaranteeing freedom of association,” new de facto discrimination is being entrenched. Private discrimination is immunized from government intervention and exempt from
                  public accountability. The unacceptable result would be that politically empowered citizens would be disempowered in such semipublic institutions as schools, hospitals, restaurants,
                  and large business.</p>
               <p class="padded">Once the government of national unity shares in the spoils of power, it will have also normalized domination. As that sharp conscience of the rulers-in-waiting, Albie Sachs, has
                  wryly reminded his comrades: “We have achieved a great victory. We have de-racialized oppression. We have done something that Apartheid never succeeded in doing—we have legitimized
                     inequality.”<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.4#X" target="_top">4</a>]</sup>

These factors combine to produce different intergroup relations in South <a name="57"></a><a href="#56"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#58"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> than in countries with distinct nationalities each in their own
                  territory. Third, deep socioeconomic cleavages—largely coinciding with race—give processes of liberalization and democratization a sharp edge of class warfare in South <a name="58"></a><a href="#57"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#59"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>. No
                  democratization can succeed without some degree of tangible equalization; enfranchisement without redistribution remains meaningless. Yet in South <a name="59"></a><a href="#58"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#60"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, a special form of
                  democratization is being attempted in order to block too radical an equalization.</p>
               <p class="normal">Finally, unlike states that endured military dictatorships and one-party rule, South <a name="60"></a><a href="#59"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#61"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> always had a functioning democracy, albeit restricted to whites. Despite the long rule of
                  the National Party, regular free elections were held among whites and the government was accountable to parliament, a relatively free press, and other institutions of civil society.
                  This distinguished South African racial authoritarianism from political totalitarianism, where no opposition or dissent are tolerated. In South <a name="61"></a><a href="#60"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#62"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> it is a question of extending
                  democracy and political equality to all citizens, not of creating democratic institutions from scratch.</p>
               <p class="normal">Unlike Chile, Brazil, and Argentina, white South <a name="62"></a><a href="#61"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#63"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> has always pretended to be a civilian government with the military under the control of the politicians. The extraordinary
                  influence of the security establishment notwithstanding, particularly during the reign of former Defence Minister P. W. Botha until 1989, the generals never took charge formally and
                  disbanded the institutions of white democracy. Therefore, “civilianization” in South <a name="63"></a><a href="#62"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#64"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> never became an issue. In any case, the Afrikaner establishment that runs the country
                  politically and bureaucratically has been so closely intertwined through the National Party, the Broederbond, and the civil service, including the security apparatus, that the Latin
                  American distinction between a castelike military and a civilian democracy does not apply.</p>
               <p class="normal">The challenge that the South African transition shares with its Latin American counterparts and particularly with the successor states of the Soviet Union lies in establishing
                  democracy in the face of a declining economy and threats to personal security. The extreme economic deprivation and deteriorating standard of living in the former Soviet states have
                  led to nostalgia for the old dictatorship, or what Russian observers call a “posttotalitarian depression.” Combined with the unrealistically high expectation about what democracy
                  could deliver materially, compared with the unjust monopoly of the ousted ruling clique, the critical transition is undermined at the very moment when it is about to be born.
                  Nostalgia for colonialism has already gripped apolitical populations in many disintegrating African states. It is also visible among a majority of Coloureds and Indians in South

               <p class="normal">However, unlike the states of the former Soviet Union under conditions of extreme economic deprivation, the new South <a name="65"></a><a href="#64"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#66"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> at least inherits a developed market economy, together

                  conventional analogies.</p>
               <p class="normal">During the 1970s and 1980s the dominant view in informed liberal and left academic opinion held that “nothing short of violent revolution and guerrilla warfare with outside support
                  has realistic prospects of destroying Apartheid” <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn179#X" target="_top">(van den Berghe 1979, 13)</a>. These observers ruled out
                  evolutionary change, since “the South African government cannot make any real changes without precipitating its own downfall” (p. 15). At the most, they expected a postponement of
                  “the day of reckoning” through tightening repression, resulting in “a permanent garrison state.” In the escalating insurgency, van den Berghe predicted, most of the whites “can be
                  expected to emigrate” until the regime “would collapse with a final rush of whites for the ships and aeroplanes” (p. 16).</p>
               <p class="normal">Though Pierre van den Berghe has offered many stimulating analyses of ethnicity, he and other academics derived their apocalyptic scenarios from false colonial analogies and from
                  American images of the U.S. departure from Vietnam. As we now know, the apartheid regime did liberalize itself, and whites overwhelmingly supported power sharing in a referendum,
                  because they wished to stay and cooperate with the black majority. And contrary to van den Berghe’s assumption, no Western government saw “support for white emigration as a
                  relatively inexpensive solution to a dangerous problem” (p. 16). In fact, most Western states not only imposed punitive sanctions but actively supported a negotiated transition to
                  democracy in South <a name="68"></a><a href="#67"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#69"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> partly in order to forestall another exodus of unwelcome refugees. Van den Berghe, like most academic analysts of decolonization, failed to grasp the
                  potential for internally motivated transformation because the concept of settler state, or <i>Herrenvolk,</i> blurred his political analysis.</p>
               <p class="normal">The concept of settler society is both useful and misleading in understanding South <a name="69"></a><a href="#68"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#70"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>—or Northern Ireland or Israel—in its historical context and in terms of the global
                  political economy. “Settler colonialism” represents a refinement of the orthodox Leninist theory of imperialism but also shares some of the crude generalizing of the Marxist theory
                  of colonialism that does not apply to specific cases. In response to those deficiencies, the South African Communist Party developed the concept of “colonialism of a special type,”
                  or “internal colonialism,” but this term also misses crucial distinctions in the processes of decolonization. It, too, obscures the interdependence of internal colonizer and
                  colonized as well as the relative independence of indigenous settlers from outside control. Nor can the traditional concepts of colonial departure and subsequent neocolonial
                  sovereignty explain what is taking place in South <a name="70"></a><a href="#69"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#71"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>.</p>
               <p class="normal">Nonetheless, it is useful to distinguish between settler colonies and colonies of exploitation. In the latter, the much more common form of pure exploitative colonization, imperial
                  powers controlled a territory through a relatively small group of administrators, soldiers, and missionaries. These colonial representatives returned home when their contracts ended,
                  and they were replaced by new male European personnel who clearly perceived themselves as sojourners. European women—with the exception of Catholic nuns and “society ladies”—seldom
                  made the hazardous journeys to the exotic colonies. Some colonial powers, particularly Portugal, even encouraged intermarriage between colonizers, natives, and imported slaves in
                  order to provide the colonial administration with a distinct mestizo class, an additional source of loyal personnel. Other colonial powers, such as France, pursued a policy of
                  assimilation for a small educated native elite, while Britain generally frowned on social integration and preferred indirect rule and control through local traditional institutions.
                  In all these colonies of exploitation the traditional institutions and customs were left largely intact, as long as they provided the expected services, slaves, markets, and access
                  to the desired local products. In many instances—for example, in the climatically inhospitable West and Central <a name="71"></a><a href="#70"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#72"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>—the European colonizers hardly penetrated the hinterland
                  outside the ports and major trading posts. Contact between the rural native population and the colonizers remained minimal and indirect.</p>
               <p class="normal">Settler colonies differed from colonies of exploitation by attracting a much larger population of European men and women for permanent settlement. Several million Europeans had
                  settled in Algeria and South <a name="72"></a><a href="#71"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#73"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> by the 1950s and 1960s; by 1960 there were 223,000 Europeans residing in Southern Rhodesia, 76,000 in Northern Rhodesia, and 68,000 in Kenya.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.5#X" target="_top">5</a>]</sup> Both France before the Algerian war of independence (1958–1962) and Portugal under Salazar (1932–1968) considered
                  their colonial territory in <a name="73"></a><a href="#72"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#74"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> an “integral part” of the motherland. Portugal made plans to increase massively the 500,000 Portuguese in Angola and the 220,000 non-Africans in
                  Mozambique before granting independence in 1974.</p>
               <p class="normal">In South <a name="74"></a><a href="#73"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#75"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, above all, much of the surplus extracted was not exported back to a metropole, as occurred in colonies of exploitation. Instead, the local reinvestment of mining
                  profits laid the foundation for the only truly industrial economy in <a name="75"></a><a href="#74"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#76"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>. In recent decades the South African economy has increasingly moved away from extractive industries and
                  agriculture to manufacturing and a service sector, which now has to compete with the rest of the world. This competitive requirement, together with the political isolation, capital
                  outflow, and lack of direct investment, has plunged the South African economy into a deep structural crisis. Nonetheless, South <a name="76"></a><a href="#75"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#77"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>’s First World industrial opportunities,
                  comparatively high wages, and pleasant climate continuously attracted new immigrants for unfilled skilled jobs, from which the native population was excluded.</p>
               <p class="normal">Several features of the historical origin and later characteristics of settler states deserve to be highlighted. In the era of decolonization, metropolitan capital favored a
                  neocolonial “independent” native state to an entity controlled by white settlers. Political decolonization was hastened by the desire of the metropole to forestall a potential
                  unilateral declaration of independence by the settlers or to risk economic secession by a province from the former colony, as threatened, for example, in Katanga. Settlers were not
                  mere agents of a mother country but developed their own identity and interests.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.6#X" target="_top">6</a>]</sup> Though cut off from outside
                  support, settlers remain part of the technologically more advanced First World and are also ideologically linked to powerful segments of the former metropole. Despite the overall
                  conflict and the desire to curtail the political and economic power of the settlers, the former metropole is reluctant to see its settler kith and kin defeated militarily. In 1965
                  British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, by his own admission, could not risk using the British military to quash the Rhodesian Unilateral Declaration of Independence for fear of
                  mutiny.</p>
               <p class="normal">In terms of settler-native relations, settler rule was usually much harsher and more oppressive than traditional colonial domination. The settlers were isolated from liberal public
                  opinion in the metropole, which, for example, pressed for the abolition of slavery. When settlers determine the law of the land, their interests dominate, rather than those of a
                  distant Crown and Church from which the natives could expect some symbolic legal protection.</p>
               <p class="normal">On the other hand, the numerically weaker settlers also had to come to terms with the natives. Dependent on the labor, taxes, and trade of the indigenous population, settlers could
                  not imitate the genocidal practices of traditional colonists. In the Americas, in contrast, the European intruders either did not need or failed to coerce the labor of the conquered
                  and they destroyed the fragmented and vulnerable native hunting-and-gathering societies. In South <a name="77"></a><a href="#76"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#78"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, though, the Europeans had to accommodate themselves to the larger,
                  better-organized herders and peasant societies. Not until the late nineteenth century did the Europeans in South <a name="78"></a><a href="#77"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#79"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> succeed fully in using superior weaponry to subjugate all
                  indigenous resistance; one recalls that the British colonial army suffered its only major defeat at the hands of the Zulus.</p>
               <p class="normal">It has often been stressed that the colonial analogy does not apply to South <a name="79"></a><a href="#78"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#80"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> for three reasons. First, during several centuries of residence the settlers have become
                  indigenous. White Africans share the land as citizens legitimately with other groups, and blacks have recognized this right provided it is applied equally and without exclusion and
                  racial privilege.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.7#X" target="_top">7</a>]</sup> Second, historical settlers cannot return to a homeland upon decolonization. Because the ties
                  to the countries of origin have long been broken, the majority of South <a name="80"></a><a href="#79"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#81"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>’s five million white settlers are not willing to emigrate; nor are any countries ready to receive them
                  as citizens or refugees. Third, because the anticolonial native movement had been defeated at the time of state independence, settler sovereignty attained worldwide legitimacy. No
                  metropole controls South <a name="81"></a><a href="#80"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#82"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> administratively, and the country is not as dependent on military or economic outside assistance for its survival as traditional colonies were.
                  Indeed, the Afrikaners pride themselves on having fought the first anticolonial war of liberation against the British at the turn of the century. Even more than Jews in Israel, white
                  South Africans consider themselves an indigenous people. In fact, a higher percentage of South African whites have resided for much longer in the conquered territory than Jews in the
                  current Israel. Even if the continued presence of a Jewish minority in Palestine since the destruction of Jerusalem two millenniums ago is acknowledged, the “resettlement,” founding,
                  and populating of Israel is a comparatively recent historical event. Zionism is a twentieth-century nationalist movement. To be sure, so is modern Afrikaner nationalism, but
                  nevertheless it can claim a longer evolution, though not a return to an ancient homeland.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.8#X" target="_top">8</a>]</sup>

               <p class="normal">The acquired indigenous status of settlers notwithstanding, they usually behave toward the natives as colonizers, and they are perceived as such by the natives. The state the
                  settlers created is an ethnic state, dominated by the symbols and political power of one group. Only members of this group are allowed to immigrate. Others are declared ethnic
                  outsiders and tolerated at best, or relegated to second-class citizenship, or denationalized in homelands, or, at worst, completely disenfranchised. The policies of victorious
                  settlers have ranged from paternalistic tutelage to assimilationism, from crude repression of traditional cultures in North America, to segregation, retribalization, and
                  denationalization in South <a name="82"></a><a href="#81"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#83"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>. In response to such policies conquered native populations have advocated various resistance strategies, from secession to military defeat, from
                  counternationalism to the boycott or destruction of the foreign invaders.</p>
               <p class="normal">In South <a name="83"></a><a href="#82"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#84"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> a stalemate developed. Neither side could defeat the other, but each could prevent the other from ruling alone. At the same time the cost of the escalating
                  confrontation weakened both sides. The internationalization of the regional conflict and the sanctions of stronger global forces heightened the need for compromise. With the end of
                  the cold war, the antagonists had lost their value as proxies. Accommodation became not only advantageous but imperative for both sides.</p>
               <p class="normal">It is the prospect of social-democratic compromise that critics of the negotiations denounce as accommodation with colonialism. The possibility of a reforming South African state is
                  denied, and the obvious resistance of whites to surrender all accumulated privileges at once and for all time is considered proof of the persistence of internal colonialism. For the
                  advocates of all-or-nothing, the “transfer of power from the enemy” (Pallo Jordan, <i>New Nation,</i> November 13, 1992, p. 14), not power-sharing, should be the goal
                  of liberation. Eventual seizure of power in a “final showdown” is advocated. A compromise is ruled out because the assumption of continued colonialism makes the defeat of the
                  colonial order by the democratic forces imperative: “It has been the ANC view that since the colonial state and the colonised people cannot be spatially separated, there is no
                  possibility of the two co-existing. This necessarily means that the struggle must result in the destruction of the colonial state,” Jordan asserts. However, those who reject
                  compromise fail to specify how the colonial masters are to be defeated, except through exhortation to more destructive struggle.</p>
               <p class="normal">Given the stalemated balance of forces, continued struggle is justified with fallacious victories. The ANC “compelled the enemy to seek negotiations”; the ANC compelled “the de Klerk
                  regime to accept our terms,” in Jordan’s perception. At the same time, Jordan admits, “we have not defeated the regime.” He astutely diagnoses Pretoria’s co-optive capacities,
                  contrary to the traditional colonial intentions invoked previously: “While quite prepared to make room for Blacks to enter the political domain, the regime is determined to so
                  condition what power the majority acquire that it will frustrate any attempts to tamper with these essentials of White power.” Lack of trust in the ability of enfranchised blacks to
                  gradually overcome colonial privileges accompanies a romanticized exaggeration of past victories.</p>
               <p class="normal">In Jordan’s view, negotiation is merely another “aspect” of struggle, not a strategy by itself through which democratic advances can be secured as a process. Instead, in a national
                  liberation struggle against colonial domination, “one or the other party to the dispute must go under,” Jordan contends: “Negotiations, in such a situation, are aimed at the
                  liquidation of the antagonists as a factor in politics.” However, it is precisely the geographical interspersion that Jordan invokes as the reason that the antagonists cannot
                  coexist, together with their economic interdependence, that forces reluctant reconciliation on the adversaries, regardless of their intentions. The alternative is joint suicide.
                  Fortunately, the ANC leadership decided for negotiations and against confrontation. This will not make the emerging arrangement between the contenders free from serious conflict and
                  competition; but it will widen the area of cooperation in an ever fluctuating pursuit of common as well as separate goals.</p>
               <p class="normal">The necessity of accommodation with local or surrounding native majorities always required settlers to devise a sophisticated ideology to legitimize their conquest and continued
                  domination. The credo was then served up for domestic consumption as well as against external opposition. Apartheid stands out as the most comprehensive blueprint to entrench racial
                  domination economically, politically, and ideologically. At the same time it deepened ideological cleavages among the ruling establishment regarding the most expedient tactics for
                  dealing with the natives. The cohesiveness of the minority was affected by immigration, secularization, urbanization and, above all, the changes created by the requirements of a more
                  skilled labor force to build an industrial economy. Though the settlers were never a monolithic group, the more they succeeded in reaping the fruits of domination, the more they
                  sowed the seeds of new divisions. English capital interests were set against the desires of the Afrikaner state bureaucracy, and relatively autonomous factions within the state vied
                  for dominance over competing departments. Farmers were deprived of subsidies and the remnants of the white working class were dropped from state protection in favor of a new
                  Afrikaner bourgeoisie that forged alliances with its English-speaking counterparts and later with an emerging black bourgeoisie.</p>
               <p class="padded">In settler states, an extreme legalism keeps these cleavages in check and regulates the high degree of state interference in the economy. While settler nationalism is not the “ethnic
                  socialism” its liberal free-market critics charge, nonetheless it relies on patronage and massive racial privileging. State and society are deeply intertwined because only through
                  the domination and manipulation of the political realm can the settlers’ privileges be maintained. Political enfranchisement threatens centuries of colonial accumulation, for the
                  numerically stronger natives could restore entitlement, empower themselves legally, and redistribute land and other spoils of conquest. Therefore, settler states are, above all,
                  embroiled in deep political conflicts. Unlike depoliticized Western liberal democracies in which civil society exists independent of the state, hardly any sphere in settler states
                  escapes politicization. The public and the private merge.</p>

               <p class="noindent">Among South African social scientists, Hermann Giliomee <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn75#X" target="_top">(1989a, 1989b)</a> and Lawrence Schlemmer stand out for their
                  insightful comparisons of South <a name="85"></a><a href="#84"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#86"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> with communal conflicts elsewhere. At the theoretical core of their writing lies the warning that ethnic identities and nationalism be taken
                  seriously. Giliomee and Schlemmer, applying lessons from intercommunal strife elsewhere, inveigh against reducing a communal competition to a class conflict. People have not only
                  material interests but ideal interests as well, the authors advise, and status concerns, emotional security, or “powerful white identity needs” could interrupt and interfere with the
                  democratic transformation in South <a name="86"></a><a href="#85"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#87"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>. For Giliomee and Schlemmer, much of the political debate denies or obscures “the essential reality of the conflict, namely, that it is
                  primarily a struggle between Afrikaner and African nationalists” <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn76#X" target="_top">(1989b, 211)</a>. African nationalism, of which the
                  ANC is seen as a vanguard, “would promote cultural homogeneity…and would impart to the state an African character to which all personnel would have to subscribe, whether they be
                  Africans or not” (p. 213).</p>
               <p class="normal">Such an assumption about the dominant opposition movement is doubtful. The ANC promotes an inclusive South Africanism, not an exclusive nationalism. Nonracialism is the antithesis of
                  communalism and nationalism. To be sure, nonracialism has not yet been tested and may well not last if it fails to be effective. While mere promises and policy statements should not
                  be taken at face value, they should also not be cast aside as untenable propaganda, adopted under the pressure of external recognition. Nonracialism is not an “unbreakable thread,”
                  as the author of an idealistically titled collection implies.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.9#X" target="_top">9</a>]</sup> It has to be constantly striven for against many
                  odds. Nonracialism also does not imply colorblindness, which would be a naive assumption after a long history of apartheid. Nonracialism merely holds out the promise that the state
                  will not recognize or tolerate race as a criterion of exclusion, private racism notwithstanding. In practice, South <a name="87"></a><a href="#86"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#88"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> resembles a multiracial rather than a nonracial society.</p>
               <p class="normal">Contrary to Giliomee’s assertion that the ANC/PAC split amounted to a mere leadership quarrel and that both are nationalist, a fundamental ideological cleavage still exists between
                  nationalist Africanists in the PAC and the nonracial, inclusive Charterists in the rational Enlightenment tradition. One of the more remarkable developments in resistance politics is
                  the recent hegemony of the ANC’s view over the Africanists’. A counterracism would have great emotional appeal among a frustrated black township youth. Yet despite the dormant PAC
                  and the more serious Black Consciousness challenge in the 1970s, the inclusive nonracialism of the ANC has so far carried the day. This happened not because of outside expectations
                  or because nonracialism offered better strategic benefits to an exiled movement dependent on foreign support, as ANC critics charge. ANC members, particularly those in the
                  internationalist SACP tradition, have generally internalized a deeply felt universalism, welcoming anyone who shared their ideological convictions. Intolerance toward proponents of
                  ethnic nationalism extends among whites and blacks (Inkatha) alike. There is no evidence that Xhosa culture has been elevated to an ethnocentric ideal, although it would only seem
                  natural that people enjoy speaking their mother tongue and display pride in their cultural heritage.</p>
               <p class="normal">Giliomee and Schlemmer hold the inevitable affirmative action programs of any postapartheid government as proof of racial group preferences. But having the nation’s ethnic diversity
                  reflected in the senior civil service or corporate culture does not constitute reverse discrimination, merely the restoration of equity. It is also not unreasonable that after
                  centuries of denigration the black majority would expect its historical presence to be respected and represented among the state symbols. Such symbolic recognition of majority
                  culture may indeed require a black African rather than a white or Indian as president of a ruling ANC party—but that would not contradict the principle of nonracialism. After
                  centuries of racial discrimination, nonracialism cannot mean colorblindness. Identical treatment of the races could itself be discriminatory because it would leave apartheid’s
                  legacies intact by focusing only on equality of opportunities rather than equality of results. Colorblind equality of opportunities without state intervention merely continues to
                  favor those who monopolized the opportunities in the past.</p>
               <p class="normal">It is unlikely that postapartheid society will produce “a liberated nation of and for Africans” where “everyone will have to defer to African symbols” <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn76#X" target="_top">(1989b, 239)</a>. Obviously, the present Afrikaner symbolic monopoly will have to be broadened with African values, Giliomee and Schlemmer would
                  readily admit. Die Stem will give way to Nkosi Sikeleli <a name="88"></a><a href="#87"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#89"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, Jan Smuts airport will become Mandela airport, and there will be many June 16th streets across the land. However, the
                  Voortrekker monument is unlikely to be blown up, Dutch Reformed churches will still be well attended, and education in Afrikaans will continue, although the biased history curriculum
                  will have to be rewritten. The ethnic character of most small towns and neighborhoods will hardly change, even after the Group Areas Act will have long been repealed. Giliomee and
                  Schlemmer predict that “the numerical preponderance of blacks will unlock the symbolic ideal of a liberated African state” <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn76#X" target="_top">(1989b, 240)</a>, yet paradoxically admit at the same time that “almost all white fears of majority rule are based on myth.”</p>
               <p class="normal">Given the record of ethnic strife around the globe, Giliomee and Schlemmer plead for open recognition of the “communal and national identities” <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn75#X" target="_top">(1989a, 238)</a> that have given rise to turmoil and bloodshed elsewhere. While such an admonition is well placed for the truly communal,
                  nationalistic conflicts in divided societies, the assumption that South African whites will have enduring nationalist symbolic needs remains questionable. Schlemmer, more than
                  Giliomee, recognizes that “white identity” differs from legitimate national self-determination elsewhere, because it is built around race privilege: “It is not so much culture in the
                  sense of deeply imbued values and rituals but "material culture’ which has been constructed around power” <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn75#X" target="_top">(1989a,
                  154)</a>. The identity of a “first-world community” threatened by the majority boils down to a conflict between haves and have-nots. Schlemmer concedes that among whites “culture
                  of origin and nationalism” is currently obscured. Apartheid racialized ethnicity and nationalized race. Both attempts failed to secure legitimacy, even among the beneficiaries. But
                  cultural nationalism that is no longer burdened with racial discrimination could clearly gain support among many sectors in the future postapartheid competition. Schlemmer fears it
                  as a “latent force particularly among Afrikaners” that “will probably come to the fore under duress” <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn75#X" target="_top">(1989a, 154)</a>.</p>
               <p class="normal">Giliomee’s and Schlemmer’s skepticism about liberal visions of individualism and the prospects of nation-building are shared not only by a vast mainstream social science literature
                  on the importance of primordialism but also increasingly by Marxist analysts. However, there are important differences in the explanations of and responses to the communal
                  phenomenon.</p>
               <p class="normal">A vast literature reveals little agreement on whether a common South African nation exists, or whether it should be forged, as well as how the resurgence of ethnonationalism
                  elsewhere in the world affects South <a name="89"></a><a href="#88"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#90"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>.

                  rationalizations for nation-killing (ethnocide) by dominant groups in the name of combating divisive tribalism by ethnic competitors. Similarly, Donald Horowitz <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn84#X" target="_top">(1991)</a> detects what he calls a meta-conflict among some dozen vastly different interpretations of what the South African problem
                  is all about. The Russian scholar and South African specialist Irina Filatova <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn60#X" target="_top">(1991)</a>, in a thorough and perceptive
                  review of the debate, concludes that all oppositional movements except Inkatha equate nation-building with socialism, “though they mean completely different things by it.” After a

                  apartheid?</p>
               <p class="normal">The difficult task of nation-building without common symbols and a unifying history has been highlighted by the debate about divisive national anthems and flags at sports events. A
                  South African nation has yet to be born. South <a name="91"></a><a href="#90"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#92"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> at present constitutes an economic and political entity, but not an emotional one. Neutral symbols negotiated for the Olympic
                  games are widely considered an unsatisfactory compromise. On home grounds, spectators at national competitions defiantly raise their symbols to the embarrassment of officials on both
                  sides, who hope to use sport to forge a common South Africanism. Thus, the ANC’s Steve Tshwete puts the onus on spectators by depicting rugby as either “a reconciler of people or…a
                  ritual that celebrates conquest and domination of black people” (<i>Business Day,</i> 20 August 1992). Judging by the emotional nature of rugby or soccer matches,
                  they seem to fit neither of these purposes for the sports-loving public. As is true the world over, sports teams provide group identity for atomized individuals who symbolically
                  borrow strength from the victory of their side. This immense psychological gratification has little to do with reconciliation or domination of the colonial outsider. It merely
                  reflects the historical segregation of sports in a divided society where the different segments, on the whole, play different sports: Afrikaners cherish rugby culture, with all its
                  customary tribal machoism, while soccer, with much more multiracial teams but uniracial spectators, has developed into an equivalent obsession in the townships.</p>
               <p class="normal">Regis Debray, a former revolutionary activist, once wrote that “during every crisis in a capitalist country it has been shown that nationalism is stronger than class identity even
                  among the main mass of the people, the working class.” This empirical evidence does not prove Walker Connor’s <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn48#X" target="_top">(1984,
                  5)</a> contention “that the most fundamental divisions of humankind are the many vertical cleavages that divide people into ethnonational groups,” let alone van den Berghe’s <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn173#X" target="_top">(1979, 58)</a> point that communalism “may well have a genetic basis.” Nonetheless, such evidence requires the
                  unrealized potential of noncommunal identity to be reconciled with the contrary evidence that ethnic mobilization seems to have been far more successful than interest-based class
                  solidarity in offering meaningful explanations of life experiences.</p>
               <p class="normal">Ancient tribalism or even evolutionary advantageous genetic conditioning are most often cited as the cause of ethnic friction. In this view, ethnic identity constitutes a
                  self-generated perception, independent of state designs and social conditions. Ethnic antagonisms, however, always occur in specific circumstances. Genetic predilections and
                  references to tribalism, therefore, do not explain the causes of a conflict but merely anthropologize antagonisms as eternal, historical givens.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.10#X" target="_top">10</a>]</sup> In failing to specify the causes of a particular antagonism, the notion of tribalism also implies that a conflict cannot be solved, only
                  contained. It is this methodological deficit of the concept—rather than its association with <a name="92"></a><a href="#91"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#93"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> and “backwardness”—that makes tribalism as a label, let alone as an explanation,
                  useless and objectionable, regardless of whether it is also applied to European conflicts.</p>
               <p class="normal">The Northern Irish “troubles,” for example, do not constitute a tribal theological war. The doctrinal issues function as symbols for much wider communal cleavages, although virtually
                  all protagonists now identify either with the label Protestant or Catholic. But it was only after 1968—when several people were injured during a civil rights march on October 5 and
                  the present Northern Ireland “troubles” were said to have been revived—that the division of society into Catholics and Protestants became so widely accepted.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.11#X" target="_top">11</a>]</sup> The largely segregated housing, schooling, workplaces, and leisure activities “tell” the profound difference between
                  Catholics and Protestants, despite the linguistic and phenotypic homogeneity.</p>

In spite of or, more likely, because of the official classifications in the
                  apartheid state, more people label themselves South Africans first, rather than black or white. Coloureds, Indians, and English-speaking whites in particular (and urban Africans to a
                  lesser extent, but rarely Afrikaners) stress their South African identity before their subgroup. In any case, the two identities are not incompatible and can be held simultaneously,
                  as even Zulu-nationalist Buthelezi has pointed out.</p>
               <p class="normal">In Northern Ireland it is impossible to be anything other than republican or loyalist, nationalist or unionist, Irish or British—either by choice or by designation of the adversary.
                  In South <a name="94"></a><a href="#93"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#95"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, however, after apartheid artifically imposed group membership on all citizens, a widespread resentment developed against communal identities and racial categories.
                  Now, nonracialism and common citizenship encourage the demise of racial identities. Black and white can celebrate their common South Africanness because they both stand to benefit
                  from it. In the truly divided Ireland, the communal conflict amounts to a zero-sum game, winners and losers; in South <a name="95"></a><a href="#94"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#96"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> all can be winners if they compromise.</p>
               <p class="normal">Moreover, in Northern Ireland the adversaries do not even use the same name for their land. Catholics hardly identify with the labels Ulster and British; Protestants eschew the label
                  Irish and vice versa. Each side plays its own sports, and in the one sport popular in both camps (soccer), they support different teams.

                  political constellation. The relative geopolitical insignificance of Northern Ireland encourages terrorism. The president of Sinn Fein may well be right when he claims that without

                  violent venues to press their case. The uncompromising domination of the majority triggers armed resistance, the last resort of the politically powerless.</p>
               <p class="normal">The communal conflict between Palestinians and Jews in Israel affords another point of contrast. The ANC strives for power; the PLO struggles for territory. The multiethnic ANC aims
                  at an inclusive democracy; the nationalist PLO advocates a Palestinian state that is likely to mirror the ethnic exclusivity of its Jewish counterpart. Both movements represent the
                  majority of an “indigenous” constituency waiting to be liberated from “colonial” conquest, but the ANC has achieved far greater international legitimacy for its claims. Both ANC and
                  PLO have been labeled “terrorists,” but the accusation has stuck much more with the PLO than the ANC, whose policy was to avoid civilian casualties and eschew indiscriminate violence
                  against an adversary who was defined in political, not ethnic, terms. </p>
               <p class="normal">The ominous comparisons of the South African right wing with the IRA or Basque-type terrorism underestimate the even more dangerous characteristics of the Afrikaner nationalists.
                  Afrikaner insurgents are proportionally much stronger numerically and, unlike the IRA, they do not depend on outside funding, expertise, and weaponry. Almost all of their male
                  members have had army training as conscripts, and many have had active battle experience in Angola. It is true that the right-wing groups are all vulnerable to penetration by state
                  agents, but, in turn, the government security apparatus is also thoroughly infiltrated with people with extreme right-wing sympathies. This battle within and about the heart of
                  Afrikanerdom distinguishes South <a name="99"></a><a href="#98"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#100"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> from communal conflicts elsewhere. It is much more an intra- rather than an intergroup struggle, both in the white and black communities.</p>
               <p class="normal">However, the intragroup pattern of violence could change quickly if, for example, high-profile assassinations or attacks could be successfully blamed on communal sentiments by the
                  other side. An accommodation that rests mainly on the appeal of leaders is fragile indeed. At present, endorsement of accommodation is soft and contingent; it does not command the
                  solid support of a large grass-roots constituency, particularly among blacks. The negotiations have been punctuated by political assassinations, though the state’s fluctuating
                  pursuit of accommodation and the legitimation of negotiation by the leadership of the ANC and SACP seem to have deterred extremist elements from attacking the top leadership. To
                  date, the violence has been aimed at undermining organizational strength or enhancing the role of certain political actors, rather than eliminating antagonists.</p>
               <p class="normal">In “Resurrecting Civil Society,” O’Donnell and Schmitter <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn128#X" target="_top">(1986, 48)</a> refer to “the success of most authoritarian
                  regimes in depoliticizing” their respective societies. Such depoliticization entails the withdrawal into private realms of most subjects; people ignore or forget their political
                  identities and tacitly accept the hegemony of the regime, willingly or by coercion. In South <a name="100"></a><a href="#99"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#101"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, however, apartheid did not allow the easy separation of private and public lives,
                  particularly since the majority of the population could not expect economic benefits from political acquiescence. Under apartheid the private realm—where one lived, where one worked,
                  how much one earned—was circumscribed by politically defined racial identity. Apartheid thus politicized the private sphere to a high degree, even at the height of repression during
                  the 1960s and 1970s. In O’Donnell and Schmitter’s analysis, the resurrection of civil society requires “corroding the normative and intellectual bases of the regime” (p. 50). But the
                  regime in South <a name="101"></a><a href="#100"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#102"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> was never based on consensus in the first place. For the excluded, the emperor has always been naked; when blacks obeyed, they complied without consenting.
                  Once tentative liberalization began, therefore, the opposition in civil society could fall back on a shared understanding, rather than having to educate and repoliticize for mass
                  action.</p>
               <p class="padded">One legacy of the extensive politicization in South <a name="102"></a><a href="#101"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#103"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> is that people now have high expectations that democracy will bring quick material improvements. A new ANC-led government
                  may find itself the victim of the same unrealistic mass expectations that the ANC and other groups encouraged during the period of repression. Should the new regime become
                  discredited but remain in power, democratization itself would be in danger of reversal. Although realistic economic policies may disappoint mass expectations, the incoming ruling
                  coalition surely cannot afford to adopt economic policies that would negatively affect growth rates and labor market conditions in the long run.</p>

Apartheid amounted to a state-sponsored enrichment of whites and state-enforced economic
                  limitations on blacks. Through the Group Areas Act, for example, the urban properties of blacks, Coloureds, and South Africans of Indian origin were confiscated for small
                  compensation; ideological resettlement threw Africans off ancient communal land. Justice demands restitution for blatant theft.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.13#X" target="_top">13</a>]</sup>

               <p class="normal">If democracy is to be meaningful, there can also be little doubt about the political necessity for some rapid material equalization. The debate about constitutions and political
                  democracy aims at who should occupy positions of authority. As theorists of democracy <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn149#X" target="_top">(Przeworski 1986)</a> have
                  always argued, the more substantive question relates to “the uses to which authority will eventually be applied” (O’Donnell and Schmitter 1986, 11). Even the liberal assumption of
                  equality of opportunity presupposes some material empowerment to compete in a market-driven economy. If the claimed competition remains grossly unequal in terms of resources, the
                  stronger individual or collectivity will impose its power on the weaker. Totally free markets only work to the benefit of the strongest; the perception of economic domination and
                  exclusion leads to strife. Ultimately, democratic systems must address the destabilizing inequality, or else abort multiparty representation in favor of authoritarian repression.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.14#X" target="_top">14</a>]</sup>
               </p>
               <p class="normal">Three additional, and specifically South African, circumstances support fundamental economic transformation. First, apartheid has created one of the most unequal societies in the
                  world. Second, this class cleavage overlaps with race to such a degree that even the United States or Brazil look progressive, though inequality was not created only by apartheid.
                  But nowhere else do poverty and race so wholly coincide with each other. Third, the capital concentration and monopoly control by the six major conglomerates in the South African
                  economy are unmatched in any other developed capitalist economy.</p>
               <p class="normal">Although economic equalization is morally justifiable, it is an entirely different question whether too radical a redistribution is pragmatically feasible. The limitations of the
                  conventional instruments of redistribution have frequently been pointed out in the South African debate.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.15#X" target="_top">15</a>]</sup> First,
                  sustained redistribution presupposes a growing economy—the very opposite of the current protracted recession. The rate of fixed investment has dramatically declined from 32 percent
                  of GDP in 1975 to 17 percent in 1991. Second, capital mobility quickly responds to perceived risks. The fear of hyperinflation through deficit financing by a new government together
                  with possibilities of nationalization reinforce cautious attitudes by investors. Third, redistribution through taxation is limited by the already high tax rate in South <a name="104"></a><a href="#103"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#105"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> and
                  the fact that the vast majority hardly pay taxes anyway. Yet it is mostly through additional new taxes—particularly a land tax, property tax, and tax on capital transfers—that future
                  social spending can be financed. Fourth, and finally, balance-of-payment constraints severely impede strategies to generate sustained growth. Peter Moll <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn122#X" target="_top">(1991, 125)</a>, in an instructive summary of the possibilities and limits of redistribution, therefore, states a widely accepted
                  view: “Racial equalisation at current white levels is impossible at the present time given South <a name="105"></a><a href="#104"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#106"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>’s level of economic development. Racial equalisation will have to be achieved
                  at substantially lower levels of expenditure per capita.”</p>
               <p class="normal">It is this prospect of “becoming an African state,” to use the code phrase of whites, that scares the white minority. They do not want to lose their standard of living and privileges
                  in education, their health system and public administration—nor do they want to pay dearly for them. With good reason, the white electorate chose to trust the National Party with
                  safeguarding their wealth and power. “Vote yes, if you are afraid of majority rule,” read one of the NP slogans during the March 1992 referendum. The National Party’s constitutional
                  designs are fully committed to entrench the existing disparities with minor modifications.</p>
               <p class="normal">The new NP strategy co-opted key demands of the opposition as its own but attached conditions that altered their consequences. Hermann Giliomee astutely defined the essence of the de
                  Klerk administration as “the attempt to seize the strategic initiative by appropriating the form of the adversary’s demand and giving it its own substance” (<i>Cape
                     Times,</i> February 3, 1991). The core principles of the ANC, nonracialism and universal franchise, were adopted by the NP but tied to minority party protection, veto rights, a
                  consensus mechanism, and a collective rotating presidency. Such a system not only invites paralysis and fragmentation but, above all, it renders majority rule subject to minority
                  agreement far beyond the prescriptions of “contingent democracy.” Contingency merely ensures that majorities “will not use their dominance to permanently exclude the losers from
                  gaining the majority…and conversely, the losers will accept the right of the winners to govern and take binding decisions” <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=bib&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=ctn176#X" target="_top">(van Zyl Slabbert 1992, 7)</a>. However, the NP designs go much further in circumscribing the rights of the winners by constitutionally entrenching existing
                  interests in the name of fundamental rights and freedoms. Parliament will not be able to override the “rule of law,” or at least not without high qualifying majorities. The law is
                  further protected by an independent judiciary that can declare laws passed by parliament unconstitutional if they conflict with the court’s interpretation of the constitution.</p>
               <p class="normal">Insofar as the new South African constitution enshrines property rights, taxation levels, and fiscal responsibilities, it freezes existing economic relations with little chance of a
                  politically motivated transformation later. A particularly devious design in this respect is Pretoria’s preemptive privatization. The ANC quite correctly states: “The current
                  privatisation programme is simply transferring wealth to a privileged few and would diminish the stock of assets and resources available to a future government to satisfy a pent-up
                  demand for social services” (<i>SouthScan,</i> April 10, 1992, p. 106). The privatization advocates are thus sowing the seeds for future unconstitutional temptations
                  by depriving the postapartheid government of one of the few means to address past injustices. For example, if large tracts of state land are now sold to the few corporate interests
                  wealthy enough to buy, a democratically elected government will come under pressure to expropriate—with or without adequate compensation.<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.16#X" target="_top">16</a>]</sup> The failure of state socialism elsewhere does not guarantee that a vast underclass in South <a name="106"></a><a href="#105"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#107"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> will tolerate its own exclusion and
                  exploitation under capitalism.</p>
               <p class="normal">Yet South African capitalism, which poses as a victim of Afrikaner nationalism, is particularly hostile to social-democratic corrections of inequality through state intervention.
                  “What we have to fear is not socialism but a kind of crippled capitalism, loaded down with remnants of socialist theory and practice, like Wilson’s Britain,” writes Ken Owen, the
                  editor of the country’s largest paper (<i>Sunday Times,</i> February 16, 1992). Such uncompromising sentiments reinforce old-fashioned class warfare from above. Peace
                  and stability, however, will depend on how well and how fast the new government can institute sensible, effective affirmative action programs, enact antitrust legislation, put unused
                  and state-subsidized land on the market for blacks to buy with state loans, upgrade black education, make low-cost housing accessible for squatters, and, above all, create jobs
                  through tax incentives—all measures requiring the fettering of free-market capitalism by democratically determined state policies. Yet, the National Party now strives for a minimal
                  state, which led Roger Southall to conclude: “They seek not so much to control a central government as to abolish it” (<i>Monitor,</i> October 1991, p. 90).</p>
               <p class="normal">It is these issues of future economic control and political power that lie at the heart of the constitutional wrangling at Codesa. Behind the rhetorical cacophonies of who should
                  represent which constituency according to which rules and with which status, the National Party and the ANC are exploring how far they can live with an economic compromise that is
                  still to be hammered out. The five working groups established by Codesa dealt with the creation of a climate for free political activity; constitution-making process and principles;
                  transitional arrangements; the future of Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, and Venda; and time-frames for the implementation of decisions. The negotiating groups have yet to tackle
                  the crucial economic compromise and the new economic order, which many falsely assume will automatically flow from political democracy. The “reasonableness” of Pretoria in abolishing
                  legal apartheid has put great pressure on the opposition to respond in kind. International opinion wants South <a name="107"></a><a href="#106"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#108"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> saved from another failed socialist experiment, and the
                  prolonged recession further pressures the ANC to accept far-reaching concessions. It appears as if the ANC cannot but accept the democratic and constitutional clamps around its
                  options. If the ANC were again to withdraw from negotiations, as it did in May 1992, it would have to return sooner or later in order to avoid a descent into barbarism.</p>
               <p class="normal">Yet for the ANC essentially to agree to the NP’s plan would be suicidal. Just as apartheid redistributed wealth to the white minority, the new government will certainly need to use
                  state intervention to benefit the black majority. Decisive will be whether the movement can stick together or fall apart once ANC incumbents are inevitably entrapped by the spoils of
                  office, and when the new government faces hard choices about who should be favored and who neglected.</p>
               <p class="normal">The pragmatists among the ANC leadership also recognize that the Afrikaner civil service and the security establishment need reassurance, not only about pensions and severance
                  benefits but also about amnesty for past offenses upon disclosure. These pragmatists are willing to accept limitations on the powers of the majority in any future government. Joe
                  Slovo even recommends “compulsory power-sharing” for a certain period rather than straight majority rule. (<i>The African Communist,</i> 3d quarter 1992, p. 40). The
                  compromising ANC negotiators have abandoned the simplistic notion that political power amounts to an addition of mere numbers. They recognize that there are other nonquantitative
                  sources of power, equally if not more important than votes: the power to disrupt and sabotage an accord if the minority is not included and, above all, the dependence on capital,
                  skills, and expertise if democratic expectations are to be fulfilled and stability is to be achieved.</p>
               <p class="normal">However, even the ANC pragmatists have a blind spot in that they recognize the interests of their adversaries only in material terms. They hope to preempt the legitimate anxieties of
                  civil servants about Africanization through guarantees and sunset clauses. The non-ANC minorities, from Afrikaner to Zulu nationalists, on the other hand, insist in addition on
                  symbolic recognition of their identities and on the right of some self-determination. The promise of mere equal treatment by an ANC-dominated central government is considered
                  insufficient. It is this recognition of ethnic claims, in which regionally concentrated minorities express themselves, that dogmatic nonracialism and an orthodox democratic vision
                  find most difficult to tolerate. The nonracial ANC has no problems with whites in government, as long as they are ANC-approved whites, while the Afrikaner and Zulu nationalists
                  insist on having representatives of their own groups recognized as equally legitimate political actors in a federal or even confederal system.</p>
               <p class="normal">It is the populist streak that the ANC represents “the people,” who are considered identical with the ANC, which logically tends to reject any outsiders or dissenters as traitors,
                  collaborators, or “non-people.” By defining itself as a liberation movement, the organization perpetuates this all-embracing claim against which opposition is by definition
                  nonliberatory and reactionary. Were the ANC to assume the mantle of a political party—which in reality it is—it would forfeit the people’s voice because it would clearly speak for
                  only a segment of the people. The same applies to the self-ascribed label “The Democratic Movement” for the tripartite alliance, which by implication defines everyone else as
                  undemocratic.</p>
               <p class="normal">Thus dissenting voices are not only repressed by Bantustan autocrats and vilified by government but are frequently also not tolerated by overeager ANC loyalists in their sphere of
                  control. A culture of intolerance poses problems for free elections, and the hoped-for replacement of bullets with ballots is said to be a naive dream since electoral competition
                  would exacerbate the violence. In the past, violent protest was directed against an undemocratic regime and its surrogates, but mutual violence in an inclusive electoral contest
                  could not claim to be legitimate resistance against apartheid exclusion. Those resorting to violence nonetheless would be heavily stigmatized.</p>
               <p class="normal">The problem remains, however, that past exclusion has not only not prepared the disenfranchised for democratic politics, but left a legacy of bitterness that sometimes leads even the
                  self-proclaimed democrats to be undemocratic. Instead of setting an example, the ANC, let alone the right wing or Inkatha, repays the state in its own currency. For instance, in
                  April 1992 more than ten thousand people gathered in Mitchells Plain to welcome de Klerk, but he was shouted down by a group of vociferous ANC supporters who pelted him with gravel
                  and forced him to depart. Such demonstrations of “victory” may backfire by inducing uncommitted voters to turn against the ANC for having violated the proclaimed freedom of speech.
                  The rhetorical support of the ANC or Inkatha leadership for the freedom of speech means little when ANC-aligned student groups will not allow Inkatha representatives to speak at any
                  liberal campus because they charge that they are not allowed to operate freely elsewhere. Many black journalists who are viewed as supporters of a rival party can list veiled threats
                  and intimidation by opponents, and local ANC supporters in the Eastern Cape have burned copies of provincial newspapers for continuously misrepresenting and neglecting ANC views.</p>
               <p class="normal">With all the major parties having their political armies to enforce dominance in their territory (SAP, MK, AWB, KZP), it will indeed be a major challenge to stage an election free of
                  intimidation. Nonetheless, an election would seem the only way to settle conflicting claims of support and bestow legitimacy on a new government. It would be naive, however, to
                  assume that elections would necessarily guarantee a future democracy. The power struggle, expectations, and emotions engendered by elections could also tempt a multiracial elite of
                  national unity to fall back on authoritarian rule in order to suppress common challengers. Both the National Party and the ANC contain hegemonic strains; their respect for liberal
                  pluralism is neither absolute nor unqualified.</p>
               <p class="normal">Nationalism avoids such antagonisms by pretending to look after all its kin at the expense of ethnic outsiders. The ANC, however, is not a nationalist movement that represents only
                  insiders. It is an inclusive, all-class, heterogeneous, basically liberal alliance to dismantle apartheid. It is therefore particularly vulnerable to splits and realignments once
                  apartheid has been abolished. Factionalism could even lead to a repetition of the 1930s, when the Communist Party denounced the ANC: “The African National Congress is now openly a
                  servant of the imperialist bourgeoisie and uses its endeavours to damp down the revolutionary activities of the masses.”<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft958009mm/ft958009mm.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e1342&amp;toc.id=ch1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=bn1.17#X" target="_top">17</a>]</sup>
               </p>
               <p class="padded">Other issues will also effect a fragmentation of existing political parties and blocs. A realignment has already taken place in white politics and among Bantustan leaders. The issue
                  of proportional representation is likely to stimulate breakaways and reinforce ideological rifts, because dissenters are no longer faced with the alternative of leaving for the
                  political wilderness. Small parties, centered more around personalities than issues, could exercise disproportional influence as they will hold the balance of power between an ANC
                  and NP bloc in the lower house. While such fragmentation will allow for the representation of many interests, it bodes ill for political stability. </p>

            <h2 class="normal">Five—<br /> Conclusion:<br /> Age of Iron</h2>
            <p class="noindent">Coetzee's most recent novel represents both summation and departure. It remains for me to outline, therefore, the long-term transitions found in the first five novels, to locate these in <i> Age of Iron</i> (1990), and, finally, to suggest how this novel extends and enriches Coetzee's whole novelistic corpus. As it is with conclusions, my argument will be brief and schematic; I have no doubt that Coetzee will continue to produce pathbreaking fiction and that future novels will necessitate qualifications and revisions that I cannot anticipate.</p>
            <p class="noindent">The corpus of Coetzee's work from <i>Dusklands</i> to <i>Foe</i> undergoes three seismic shifts. The first shift involves the problem of authority. From a combative, aggressive subversion of the authority of colonialism and its discourses, Coetzee's fiction develops toward a point of self-conscious deference, marginality, even abnegation. Friday's silence is the culmination of this development, for here Coetzee takes his reader as far as it is logically possible to go into a recognition and dramatization of the historical constraints that influence his fiction writing. Having challenged the authority of the colonial legacy and the forms of ideology that obscured its destructiveness, Coetzee begins interrogating the discursive authority in whose name the subversion is enacted. Collectively, the novels illustrate Coetzee's contention, in the conclusion to his essay on the farm novel and <i>plaasroman,</i> that although "our ears today are finely attuned to modes of silence," it is a form of reading that, "subverting the dominant, is in peril, like all triumphant subversion, of becoming the</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">119</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">dominant in turn" (<i>White Writing</i> 81). Coetzee's fiction declines such triumphalism, providing in its place a clear-eyed representation of its own historical positioning and the limits of its power.</p>
            <p class="noindent">In the second shift Coetzee moves away from an emphasis on discourse as an ideological structure in which the subject is pinioned, doomed to live out the forms of subjectivity imposed by history; rather, in the later fiction textuality emerges as a self-generating, protean dynamic that opposes the fixed structures of historical consciousness. This transition parallels developments taking place in his linguistic and literary critical scholarship: throughout the 1970s, in his work in stylistics Coetzee was drawn to the possibility that epistemologies could be located in the structures of language; by the mid-1980s—especially in the essay on confession in Rousseau, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky, which is Coetzee's most substantial single piece of criticism—he is emphasizing the limitlessness of textuality or, more strictly, the relationships between limitlessness, self-knowledge, and forms of closure. In <i>Foe</i> we find a mode of textuality that, although conscious that it can be forced into silence, involves an endlessly elaborating skepticism that makes it virtually impossible to impose on it a symptomatic diagnosis of its "unconscious." Indeed, Coetzee's form of self-conscious textuality continually reaches into itself and uncovers the conditions of its own production—until a final limit appears that is simply the impossibility of further elaboration, the limit of silence or death.</p>
            <p class="noindent">In the third shift Coetzee rejects liberal humanism as an ideology useful to the colonial enterprise and begins to propose the necessity, certainly the desirability, of a reconstructed ethics in which certain traditional liberal values find a new relevance within an all-consuming and humanly damaging political struggle. <i>Dusklands</i> revels at times in aggressiveness, and its exposure of colonial violence is a deliberate affront to the evasions of liberal humanism; in <i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i> and <i>Life and Times of Michael K,</i> however, Coetzee begins to suggest that there is some distance between, on the one hand, recognizing or refusing the compromises of liberal humanism and its unwillingness to confront the inherent violence of colonialism and, on the other hand, abandoning altogether its traditional respect for the quality of human relationships and the social body in which they are formed. The need for reciprocity, the integrity of childhood, the possibility of community, the status of compassion or charity—such values surface more and more frequently in Coetzee's writing as haunting reminders of a kind of historical deprivation suffered by the people as a whole. The</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">120</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">deprivation takes root, it must be said, with the arrival of the settler. As the epigraph to <i>White Writing</i> puts it, in lines drawn from Ovid's <i>Metamorphosis:</i> "Pressing his lips to foreign soil, greeting the unfamiliar mountains and plains, Cadmus gave thanks. …Descending from above, Pallas told him to plow and sow the earth with the serpent's teeth, which would grow into a future nation." Coetzee's ethicalism is stripped of liberal ideology and infused with historical sensitivity.</p>
            <p class="noindent">If <i>Foe</i> presents a questioning of narrative authority, <i> Age of Iron</i> puts a harder case: What does it mean to write <i> without</i> authority? Elizabeth Curren is dying of cancer in a society wracked with another kind of malignancy, a society given over entirely to the contest for power. This is not a contest for ideological hegemony; the struggle over ideas has ceased, and now either the state or the people will prevail. The police have a free hand under emergency regulations to dispense casual injury or death at random, and they do so; on the other side, the young militants of the townships have resorted to a hardened rhetoric of absolutes, sacrificing their youth to the all-encompassing demands of the struggle. Coetzee is responding to conditions during the worst years of the States of Emergency, 1986–1989—also the years given for the novel's composition. Perhaps the most striking feature of this period, politically, was the warfare conducted by the security forces against the insurrectionary youth, who were inspired in turn by a notion of "ungovernability" defined by the exiled political leadership, partly in response to the growing mood of the townships and the internal successes of the United Democratic Front. Coetzee uses two memorable slogans of the period: "liberation before education" (62) and "freedom or death" (149). Although several of the novels are similarly referenced to particular moments in contemporary South African history, Coetzee seems far less chary in <i>Age of Iron</i> about using representational discourse. The wet squalor of Cape Town's squatter camps, the cruelty of black vigilantes, the brutal efficiency with which the police kill comrades accused of belonging to underground cells—Coetzee incorporates such features of the conflict directly into his portrayal. "Friday," too, speaks in this novel, in the full authority of his appropriation of power. Indeed, the black voices in <i>Age of Iron</i> are articulate and diverse, from the simple, uncompromising declarations of Bheki and his activist friend, to the self-assurance of Florence, Elizabeth's char, and, finally, to the chilly eloquence of Thabane, the teacher turned tradesman who puts the comrades' case to Elizabeth with steely accuracy.</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">121</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">Characteristically, however, <i>Age of Iron</i> also goes much further than the representation of political conditions. The Other in <i>Age of Iron</i> is no longer the historical Other of colonialism: with black speech fully "represented," the interlocutor changes as well, becoming the taciturn derelict Vercueil, Elizabeth's consort and Angel of Death. The silencing of discourse is therefore no longer simply a function of political power, as it is in <i>Foe;</i> it has now become associated with the event of death itself. Three familial deaths are mentioned in the novel's dedication; the shift beyond the historical Other would seem to be connected to personal bereavement. But whatever its origin, Coetzee's question is this: What kind of discourse emerges from a narrative subject who has not made peace, exactly, with the historical Other, but for whom there is <i>another kind of limit</i> against which to speak? From the point of view of the subject, after all, the "final horizon" cannot be the broadly historical—as we have become accustomed to saying—but if so, is it not possible for the novel to stage a "conflict of limits"? What kind of discourse would such a conflict produce? These are the terms on which <i>Age of Iron</i> is built. Let me return, at this point, to the three categories raised earlier in the discussion of Coetzee's development, namely those of authority, textuality, and ethics.</p>
            <p class="noindent">While "the country smoulders," Elizabeth says, her attention "is all inward, upon the thing, the word, the word for the thing inching through my body. An ignominious occupation, and in times like these ridiculous too, as a banker with his clothes on fire is a joke while a burning beggar is not" (36). If Elizabeth has any authority, it is provided by her very irrelevance; it is the authority of the disparaged, of a retired lecturer in classics whose canon means little to anyone but herself, undergoing a private death.</p>
            <p class="noindent">On textuality, Elizabeth says, "Death may indeed be the last great foe of writing, but writing is also the foe of death. Therefore, writing, holding death at arm's length, let me tell you that I meant to go through with it, began to go through with it, did not go through with it" (106). Elizabeth is speaking here of her ridiculous plan to immolate herself in front of the Houses of Parliament, partly as a condemnation of the crimes of the state but also as a way of making her private death a public one, thus altering the scale on which it is valued. This does not happen; her death remains private. Her writing takes the form of a letter addressed to a daughter who has emigrated to America and will have nothing more to do with South <a name="73"></a><a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft5k4006q3/ft5k4006q3.xml&amp;chunk.id=d0e2541&amp;toc.id=d0e2541&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;set.anchor=72" target="_top"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#74"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, at least not until the present rulers have passed on. The letter becomes a "rope of words" (181) that</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">122</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">binds the daughter to the mother, forcing her to hear Elizabeth out. What Elizabeth says is no more important, in this configuration, than the fact that she finds a way to speak: <i> writing</i> becomes Elizabeth's mode of temporary self-preservation.</p>
            <p class="noindent">The skepticism and inconsequentiality of Elizabeth's discourse enable her to say exactly what she pleases about the way the national conflict is conducted. The ethicalism of <i>Age of Iron</i> emerges from this paradox. Elizabeth's judgment of the rule of white nationalism, the rule of the "boars," is direct and unsubtle. On the insurrection she is harsh, indeed confessional, in her condemnation of the new forms of puritanism and militarism evident in the township youth. To Thabane, for example, she says:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="noindent">I fear I know comradeship all too well. The Germans had comradeship, and the Japanese, and the Spartans. Shaka's impis too, I'm sure. Comradeship is nothing but a mystique of death, of killing and dying, masquerading as what you call a bond (a bond of what? Love? I doubt it). I have no sympathy with this comradeship. You are wrong, you and Florence and everyone else, to be taken in by it and, worse, to encourage it in children. It is just another of those icy, exclusive, death-driven male constructions. That is my opinion. (137)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noindent">These opinions count for nothing: she and Thabane "agree to differ." Thus, <i>Age of Iron</i> takes the process of ethical reconstruction further, but it does so by disclaiming the authority of the narrator. We need to ask, What kind of authority is it that rests on the assertion of its own irrelevance? Or more specifically: What conditions in South <a name="74"></a><a href="#73"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#75"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, pertaining to ethical judgment, produce such a circuitous mode of address? The answer lies in the fact that ethical consciousness in South <a name="75"></a><a href="#74"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#76"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> is constrained because judgment is invariably selective or interested. The Magistrate's attempts in <i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i> to appeal to simple standards of decency were crippled by their complicity. Complicity is the result of having a constituency, of speaking (wittingly or not) on behalf of a group of dominant actors in the conflict. Within such conditions, speaking <i>without</i> authorization, or with an authority few are willing to take seriously in a society in which the "line" is a carefully managed mechanism for conducting the war rhetorically, could be one way in which ethical judgment can be partially restored.</p>
            <p class="noindent">The novel dramatizes this tension precisely: asked to "name the crime" she has witnessed on seeing a party of vigilantes burning the shacks of families suspected of sympathizing with the comrades, Eliza-</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">123</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">beth says such sights are to be condemned, but she "cannot denounce them in other people's words. I must find my own words, from myself. Otherwise it is not the truth" (91). Such expressions of misgiving or restraint about how judgment is exercised could be said to constitute an attempt on Coetzee's part to restore judgment to the public sphere—or, at least, to imagine judgment being restored there. Speaking of Gordimer's treatment of cruelty in <i> Burger's Daughter,</i> Coetzee said in 1986—the year he began working on <i>Age of Iron</i> —that what Rosa Burger anticipates is "a time when humanity will be restored across the face of society," a time "when all human acts …will be returned to the ambit of moral judgement. In such a society it will once again be <i>meaningful</i> for the gaze of the author, the gaze of authority and authoritative judgement, to be turned upon scenes of torture" ("Into the Dark Chamber" 35).</p>
            <p class="noindent">Coetzee's skepticism, his deferential handling of the politics of agency, have prevented him, thus far, from projecting forward to a moment such as this. Although <i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i> explores two versions of temporality defined by Frank Kermode, namely <i>kairos</i> and <i>chronos,</i> it omits Kermode's third term, which is <i>pleroma,</i> the "fullness of time." Coetzee's <i>pleroma,</i> it seems, would be the restoration of judgment, or at least the creation of conditions in which judgment would become possible once again. Such a moment is projected negatively in <i> Age of Iron</i> in the dramatization of the <i>failure</i> of reciprocal judgment before scenes of cruelty:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="noindent">"This woman talks shit," said a man in the crowd. He looked around. "Shit," he said. No one contradicted him. Already some were drifting away.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="noindent">"Yes," I said, speaking directly to him—"you are right, what you say is true."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="noindent">He gave me a look as if I were mad.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="noindent">"But what do you expect?" I went on. "To speak of this"—I waved a hand over the bush, the smoke, the filth littering the path—"you would need the tongue of a god."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="noindent">"Shit," he said again, challenging me. (91)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noindent">In summary, <i>Age of Iron</i> shows that the transitions taking place in Coetzee's novels are inexplicable except as the consequence of a consistent and increasingly refined sense of the historicity of fictional discourse under South African conditions. This is true of the forms of authority the novels invoke and scrutinize, the notions of textuality they inscribe, and the ethical consciousness they propose or prepare for.</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">124</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">
               <i>Age of Iron</i> provides a lucid image of this complex historicity that emerges from a developmental reading of Coetzee's writing. Examining a photograph of her two American grandsons paddling a canoe in a recreational resort, Elizabeth cruelly tells her daughter that "it dispirits me that your children will never drown. All those lakes, all that water: a land of lakes and rivers; yet if by some mischance they ever tip out of their canoe, they will bob safely in the water, supported by their bright orange wings, till a motor-boat comes to pick them up and bear them off and all is well again" (178). She then adds:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="noindent">By no means do I wish death upon them. The two boys whose lives have brushed mine are in any event already dead. No, I wish your children life. But the wings you have tied on them will not guarantee them life. Life is dust between the toes. Life is dust between the teeth. Life is biting the dust.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="noindent">Or: life is drowning. Falling through water, to the floor. (179)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noindent">In a novel which is so much about dying, it is ironic that one of Elizabeth's responses to her daughter—whose own form of "iron" is her unbending will never to return—is to declare that <i>she</i> is the one passing on a legacy of death. In an interview with the <i>Washington Post,</i> Coetzee glosses this moment as follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="noindent">There is a certain controversy, isn't there, going on right at the moment in the United States about the "end of history"? …The position, expressed in a very crude way, is that the Western democracies have reached a stage in historical development in which development ceases because there is no stage beyond it. For better or worse liberal democracy is the form toward which all history tends…. That very way of seeing the history of mankind is a symptom of the First World…moving to a plateau of inconsequentiality or irrelevance. It's actually the Third World where history, real history, is happening. And the First World has played itself out of the game. (Coetzee, "Author on History's Cutting Edge," C4)<sup class="ref">[<a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft5k4006q3/ft5k4006q3.xml&amp;chunk.id=nsd0e2666&amp;toc.id=endnotes&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;anchor.id=d0e2863#X" target="_top">1</a>]</sup>
               </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="noindent">The passage, and this statement, must bring us to the end of our study, for they return us to the site of history and present it, remarkably in Coetzee, as a place of privilege. Between the publication of the novel and this gloss, of course, lies a crucial moment in South <a name="76"></a><a href="#75"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa's</span></span> <a href="#77"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> history, namely February 1990, which saw the unbanning of exiled organizations, the release of numbers of political prisoners, and tentative negotiations toward a transition to democracy. This shift partly explains Coetzee's relative optimism. A year later, negotiations proper had not yet begun and the country was still riven with violence; at that point, Coetzee might have been less sanguine. But the statement is less a</p>
            <hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">125</span> ―</div>
            <p class="noindent">reflection of the current state of affairs in South <a name="77"></a><a href="#76"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#78"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> than a reminder of the extent to which historicity has informed Coetzee's oeuvre from the very beginning. In hindsight we can see that Coetzee's return to South <a name="78"></a><a href="#77"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#79"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> at the start of the 1970s had the effect of ensuring that his fiction would escape the consequences of the "posthistorical" age, that ultimately we would find in his novels a dramatic confluence of postmodern ideas and the history-making exigencies of a society in turmoil.</p>
            <p class="noindent">There can be no such thing, of course, as living "outside" history. Coetzee's novels have been rigorous in developing a sense of the situatedness of their subjects. But these novels have also projected themselves <i>beyond</i> their situation, alerting us to the as yet unrealized promise of freedom. Let me conclude by returning to the epigraph at the beginning of this study, to Coetzee's remark that he sees his novels as representations of "people slipping their chains and turning their faces to the light." In its encounter with the brutality of South <a name="79"></a><a href="#78"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="#80"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a>, and having absorbed the epistemological insecurities of postmodernism, Coetzee's fiction is more than conscious of its own precariousness. It is as vulnerable, in fact, as Elizabeth Curren's long letter to her daughter, entrusted to the hands of the drunken Vercueil after her death. Yet in <i>Age of Iron,</i> which is Elizabeth's text, South <a name="80"></a><a href="#79"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_inprev.gif" border="0" alt="previous hit" /></a> <span class="hitsection"><span class="subhit">Africa</span></span> <a href="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/view?docId=tei/ft5k4006q3/ft5k4006q3.xml&amp;chunk.id=nsd0e47&amp;toc.id=nsd0e47&amp;brand=default;query=africa&amp;set.anchor=81" target="_top"><img src="http://espresso.ad.ucop.edu:8084/xtf/icons/default/b_innext.gif" border="0" alt="next hit" /></a> means not only death—the renunciation of authority and the end of discourse—but also, because it is these things, the "dust between the teeth," an engagement with history that is in itself an act of transcendence.</p>

<p>This package contains a heavily modified version of Lucene's &quot;span&quot; 
  query/scoring structure, adapted to XTF's strategy of dividing large documents 
  into small chunks. </p>
<p>To maintain the illusion of a single large contiguous document, it was necessary 
  to overlap each chunk with the next chunk. Unfortunately, this opens the possibility 
  of getting a span hit in the overlapping portion; the job of the <a href="DedupeQueue.html">DedupeQueue</a> 
  class is to detect and resolve such overlaps.</p>
<p>Lucene's Span classes (such as <a href="SpanNearQuery.html">SpanNearQuery</a> 
  and its span generator, <a href="NearSpans.html">NearSpans</a>) have been adapted 
  to provide a score for each span, and minor modifications have been made to 
  improve their behavior.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="SpanScorer.html">SpanScorer</a> has been modified to report 
  the final set of <a href="SpanHit.html">SpanHit</a>s to a <a href="SpanHitCollector.html">SpanHitCollector</a>, 
  used by XTF to eventually form Snippets of source text.</p>

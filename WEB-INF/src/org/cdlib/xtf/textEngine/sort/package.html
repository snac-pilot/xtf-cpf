<p>This package contains a very slightly modified version of Lucene's field sorting 
  classes, adapted for use within XTF's chunk-based text query system.</p>
<p>Most of the classes are exact copies from Lucene, with only a few members made 
  public so they can be re-used.</p>
<p>One new class, <a href="SparseStringComparator.html">SparseStringComparator</a>, 
  is like a normal string comparator except that it compacts all the empty entries 
  out of the array. This is very desirable in the XTF world, where most document 
  IDs are actually chunks. When sorting documents, an array containing every chunk 
  and document would be needlessly huge. </p>

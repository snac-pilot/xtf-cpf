This directory contains two kinds of classes:

(1) Code back-ported from the upcoming, but not yet completed, Lucene 1.9 subversion trunk. They are considered to be stable, and are needed to properly handle span queries on large indexes.

(2) Minor changes to Lucene itself, to make it more extensible, with the hope that these changes will soon be incorporated into Lucene.
